## An arbitrary topology SRM model which allows for changing weights at each iteration.

def W_func_sim(N, Ni, W, U, BETA, v_thresh = 3, v_reset = 0, t_eps = 1e-2, t_end = 10):
    """
    Filter-based simulation with functional-valued weight matrices, time stepping by t_eps.

    Assumes instantaneous resets (reset function is -nu*delta, where this is Dirac's delta), and a postsynaptic kernel function of exp(-dt).

    :param N: The number of neurons to simulate
    :param Ni: The number of input functions
    :param W: A function of a single variable, time, which returns a (possibly asymmetric) matrix of size (N,N), giving the connection weights of the simulated neurons at the time specified by the argument to the function.
    :param U: A function of a single variable, time, which returns a matrix of size (Ni,N) giving the connection strength from each source function to each neuron in the network at the time passed to the function.
    :param BETA: A function of a single variable, time, which returns a vector of size (Ni) giving the result of evaluating each source functional at time specified by the input.
    :param v_thresh: A real scalar: if the potential of a neuron exceeds this limit, a firing event is triggered.
    :param v_reset: A real scalar: what is the initial potential of each neuron, as well as what the potential is reset to after a firing event.
    :param t_eps: The time stepping constant.
    :param t_end: The length of the simulation. The simulation thus involves t_end / t_eps many iterations.

    Returns a dictionary with elements Fcal, a list of lists, of each list giving the firing times of a particular neuron, and Vs, a numpy array giving the potential of each neuron at each time step. Neurons are represented as columns, and time points as rows.

    Example useage:
    # Constant weight matrices and residual functionals
    np.random.seed(123)
    N = 3# Number of neurons
    Ni = 1# Number of input neurons
    W_0 = np.random.normal(size=[N,N])
    W = lambda t: W_0
    U_0 = np.abs(np.random.normal(size=[Ni,N]))
    U = lambda t: U_0

    BETA = lambda t: np.zeros(shape=[Ni]) + t

    ret = W_func_sim(N, Ni, W, U, BETA)
    ret['Fcal']#Prints out firing times
    ret['Vs']# Prints out trace of electric potential.
